# Drowsiness Detection and Alarming System

## Introduction
The drowsiness detection and alarming system, characterized by its reliance on Python and machine learning, represents a groundbreaking project aimed at addressing the critical issue of driver fatigue.
This innovative system has the potential to significantly reduce the alarming frequency of road accidents occurring worldwide on a daily basis, thereby enhancing road safety and saving countless lives.

The project has basically two important tasks:
1. Continuosly detecting face and eye movement of the driver.
2. Alarming the driver if drowsy eyes are detected.

## Required Components
The project requires following three Python libraries to function:
1. OpenCV: For real-time face and eye detection.
2. Pygame: To trigger alarm sounds upon detecting drowsiness.
3. Threading: For managing concurrent tasks efficiently, such as handling real-time video processing alarm triggering independently.
